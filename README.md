# ⚽ PlayerLens

PlayerLens is an end-to-end football analytics web application that evaluates a footballer’s **Impact Score** using machine learning and provides a transparent **impact breakdown** across key performance dimensions.

Unlike traditional rating systems, PlayerLens focuses on **model-driven influence**, not just raw attributes.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 Search any player from the dataset
- 📊 Machine-learning–based Impact Score
- 🧠 Impact Breakdown:
  - Ability (technical skill & contribution)
  - Physical (stamina, strength, athleticism)
  - Consistency (performance stability)
- 👤 Player Snapshot:
  - Position
  - Height & Weight
- 📈 Top contributing attributes
- 🌐 Modern dark-themed frontend

---

## 🧠 How the Impact Score Works

The Impact Score is generated by a trained machine learning model.

- Player attributes are aggregated and engineered
- Missing values are handled via an imputer
- A regression model predicts relative player impact

### ⚠️ Important Design Insight (Differentiability)

High values in **Ability / Physical / Consistency do NOT guarantee a high Impact Score**.

**Why?**
- Impact Breakdown → descriptive strength
- Impact Score → learned influence from historical data

This separation is intentional and makes PlayerLens **explainable rather than misleading**.

## ▶️ Running the Project Locally

### 1️⃣ Start Backend

```bash
uvicorn app.backend.main:app --reload
```

Backend runs at:

```
http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

---

### 2️⃣ Run Frontend

- Open `frontend/index.html` using **Live Server**
- Ensure backend is running before searching players

---

## 🌐 API Endpoints

| Endpoint | Description |
|--------|------------|
| `/` | API health check |
| `/players` | List all players |
| `/player/{player_id}` | Player impact details |

---

## 🚧 Known Limitations

- Club history section is currently a placeholder
- Model is position-agnostic
- Dataset-specific biases may exist

---

## 🔮 Future Improvements

- Position-aware impact models
- Player comparison view
- Club history timeline
- Visual charts for attribute contributions
- Deployment (Render / Vercel)

## ⭐ Final Notes

PlayerLens prioritizes:
- ML correctness
- Explainability
- Clean system design

This project is built as a **learning-first ML system**, not a surface-level analytics app.
