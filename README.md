# ⚽ PlayerLens

PlayerLens is an end-to-end football analytics web application that evaluates a footballer’s **Impact Score** using machine learning and provides a transparent **impact breakdown** across key performance dimensions.

Unlike traditional rating systems, PlayerLens focuses on **model-driven influence**, not just raw attributes.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 Search any player from the dataset
- 📊 Machine-learning–based Impact Score
- 🧠 Impact Breakdown:
  - Ability (technical skill & contribution)
  - Physical (stamina, strength, athleticism)
  - Consistency (performance stability)
- 👤 Player Snapshot:
  - Position
  - Height & Weight
- 📈 Top contributing attributes
- 🌐 Modern dark-themed frontend

## 🧠 How the Impact Score Works

The Impact Score is generated by a trained machine learning model.

- Player attributes are aggregated and engineered
- Missing values are handled via an imputer
- A regression model predicts relative player impact

### ⚠️ Important Design Insight (Differentiability)

High values in Ability / Physical / Consistency **do not guarantee** a high Impact Score.

Why?
- Impact Breakdown = descriptive strength
- Impact Score = learned influence from data

This separation is intentional and makes PlayerLens explainable rather than misleading.
